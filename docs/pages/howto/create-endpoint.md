Before a build or release pipeline is created it is a good idea to create the Habitat endpoint.

1. In VSTS go to the project home page and click on **'Services'** from the **'Settings'** (cog icon) menu.
    * From here a new _Habitat Origin_ will be created that will hold your specific Habitat details, such as the origin name and key for example.

2. From the left hand menu click on **'New Service Endpoint'** and then click on **'Habitat Origin'**.

3. A dialog box will be displayed requesting several bits of information, this is detailed in [[Habitat Endpoint]]. Complete as required and save the endpoint.
