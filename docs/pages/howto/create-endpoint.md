Before a build or release pipeline is created it is a good idea to create the Habitat endpoint.

 1. In Azure DevOps go to the project for which the Habitat Endpoint is required.
 2. Click on **'Project Settings'** at the bottom of the left hand navigation pane
 3. Click on **'Service Connections'**
 4. Click on the **'New service connection'** drop down and click on **'Habitat Origin'**
 5. Complete the dialog box with the relevant information. Refer to the [Habitat Endpoint](/habitat-endpoint.html) page for more information.
